<p>Hi! We've designed this game as a sort of experiment when it comes to people doing tasks<br>
  and the feedback they get. So as you can see, there are 2 buttons below this paragraph. One will<br>
  encourage you as you play the game where as the other one won't be so nice. And then you'll get to<br>
  see how you do with both. Ready, set & go!
</p>

<button onclick="positiveQuote()">Be Nice</button>
<button onclick="negativeQuote()">Be Not So Nice</button>
